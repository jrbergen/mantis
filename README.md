# tmap_defectdetector

ML based defect detector (Project in planning phase).

Main steps involved in the development of a Machine Learning Algorithm are:

Import dataset (Input and Output)
          |
          \/
Pre-processing (Filtering, upsizing/downsizing)
          |
          \/
Build model or fit regressions to data
          |
          \/
Vizualize Results Graphically and 
compare with validation

## Part I - Wine Quality Predictor
Here we see a linear regression Machine Learning Algorithm applied to a generalized data for 
determining quality of wine based on different parameters such as alcohol content, density, pH, etc.

## Part II - Image Defect Predictor
Here, a machine learning algorithm which utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network is used to detect and classify 
defects on solar panels based on surface scratches on them.
